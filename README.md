This repository contains a demonstration of a common bug in PHP involving recursive object comparison. The `foo` function attempts to recursively compare two objects for equality, but it incorrectly handles array comparisons, returning `false` even when the arrays are deeply equal. The solution demonstrates the correct way to handle this issue, ensuring that array comparisons are correctly handled.
